	<li>gear swap(?) 
</ol>
<b>Flow Guages</b>
<ul>
	<li>usgs to river mapping 
	<li>use boater logs on non-guaged rivers to allow data driven level estimates based on correlations to other guages.
	<li>Easy to navigate, personal favorites, etc.
</ul>

<b>Confessional</b> - section of photos of people drinking out of shoes 

<b>Gear Swap</b>
<br> - photo integration
<br> - location integration
<br> - in app payment via PayPal / venmo / bitcoin

<b>Maps integration</b>
<br> - Google maps with gis layovers
<br> - rapid-level difficulty coloring
<br> - put in / take out markers and maps
<br><br>
<b>User Profiles</b>
<br> - pictures
<br> - public and/or private paddling logs
<br> - embedded social media or blog posts? 
<br><br>
<b>User profiles as social media platform</b>
<br> - follow other people? 
<br> - connecting novices with teachers 
<br> - connecting people with educational resources
<br> - connecting people with clubs
<br> - connecting wandering boaters with locals
<br> - check out potential paddling partners history
<br><br>
<b>River profiles</b>
<br> - usgs levels
<br> - maps with visually appealing overlays
<br> - international and addison scales
<br> - use anonymous paddling logs to track swims at rapids and water levels
<br> - hazards (user reported in last x days gives front page warning icon)
<br> - warnings
<br> - directions
<br> - river specs
<ul>
	<li>mileage
	<li>gradient
</ul>
- top boaters
<br>" "- Facebook like friends box
  - click it, get ranked list
  - rankings could include days in last year, river level dispersion, etc
- photos
- rapid descriptions

Groups we love
  - AW, ACA, TeamScum, TNC
  - Logo / link / tagline

Working with AW
- incident log (standardized)
  - mapped to rapids 
  - mapped to flow level
- swim logs
  - mapped to levels
  - mapped to rapids
  - mapped to hazards
  - anonymized
  - predictive analytics on when rivers are dangerous

Other partners
- anonymous boater log data
  - what kind of boat did you paddle
  - what level
- possibilities
  - paddling companies
  - advocacy groups
- team scum ("you want a cool hat?")

Implementation
- back end
  - Linux servers
  - python analytics
  - mysql databases
- app development
  - android
  - iPhone
  - tablet
- ux / ui
- visual design
- website
  - "at home" functionality for app for original focus
  - maybe expand to "primary" focus
- proof of concept build
  - pick some rivers
  - example users
  - build out some example data to create analytics
  - need a "what we can do for you" pitch to get AW on board
