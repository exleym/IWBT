#Brainstorming Session
###Exley and Rob
###12 July 2015 - Drive back from Ausable Chasm
This is a summary / compilation of the notes from the initial brainstorming 
session for our river app, tentatively codenamed IWBT.  

**Priority List:**
  * flows
  * maps
  * boating log
  * user profiles
  * social networking
	* internal - top boaters for a river, other pride points
    * external - allow interface with twitter / fb / instagram
  * gear swap(?) 
  
**Flow Guages**
  * usgs to river mapping 
  * use boater logs on non-guaged rivers to allow data driven level 
	estimates based on correlations to other guages.
  * Easy to navigate, personal favorites, etc.  

**Confessional** - section of photos of people drinking out of shoes 

**Gear Swap**
  - photo integration
  - location integration
  - in app payment via PayPal / venmo / bitcoin 

**Maps integration**
  - Google maps with gis layovers
  - rapid-level difficulty coloring
  - put in / take out markers and maps

**User Profiles**
  - pictures
  - public and/or private paddling logs
  - embedded social media or blog posts? 

**User profiles as social media platform**
  - follow other people? 
  - connecting novices with teachers 
  - connecting people with educational resources
  - connecting people with clubs
  - connecting wandering boaters with locals
  - check out potential paddling partners history

**River profiles**
  - usgs levels
  - maps with visually appealing overlays
  - international and addison scales
  - use anonymous paddling logs to track swims at rapids and water levels
  - hazards (user reported in last x days gives front page warning icon)
  - warnings
  - directions
  - river specs
    - mileage
    - gradient

**top boaters**
  - Facebook like friends box
  - click it, get ranked list
  - rankings could include days in last year, river level dispersion, etc 
  photos
  - rapid descriptions

**Rivers I want to boat**
  - add rivers to "to do list"
  - notifications on appropriate levels for favorite rivers

(I actually hate the shit out of this idea -- fuck facebook)
>**Boater log** 
>  - Social media integration
>  - Automatically generate posts for each checked social platform
>  - "I went boating today"
>  - Ability to follow people's "I went boating today" feeds.
